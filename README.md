# hello-world
Alright, here goes is the first repo.

Hi! My name is Artem. I'm startingm y journey in thw Data Science. I relized that i want to do that, when my company is being very conservative and manual, despite declaring its way for the innovetion. I wanted to automate tons of staff, so i've started to work with python. Soon it escaleted into my new interest - data analysis and ended up in Data Science. Will see how it goes.
